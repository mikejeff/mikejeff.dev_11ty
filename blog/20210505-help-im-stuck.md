Our not quite two year old son has been obsessed with trucks for a good portion of his life now. Particularly, "helper trucks" — ones that have a purpose beyond hauling stuff — Fire trucks, ambulances, and tow trucks. The tow truck scenario starts with him yelling "Help! I'm stuck in the mud!" then a tow truck comes and pulls the car out. The long and short of this post is that sometimes in my career I feel like I'm stuck in the mud, just spinning my wheels trying to get out.

The rub in my scenario here is that I am also the tow truck. I need to find ways to pull myself out of the mud and keep going. I have a pretty clear idea of where I want to end up in my career, and it may be kind of a winding one. I want to be a web developer who specializes in user experience and accessiblity. There. I said it. But, the "mud" I'm stuck in is what languages I can learn/master to best suit my goal. I know I need to work on mastering Javascript, but on top of that, I am constantly drawn to other tecnologies like Gatsby (yes, I know it's built with React), and Wordpress (yes, I know people dislike PHP, but you can't argue with WP's current place in the web.) It's a lot to do in what little spare time I have.

My fiancee always says to start with a to-do list, and add that task to the top of the list. When you're done making your to-do list, you have already completed your first task. I think I'll start there today. It's not big progress, but it's progress none the less. Put it on paper and move things around until things start making sense. Bam. Done. Good talk.

I may still be stuck in the mud when the list is done, but the tow truck's coming soon.
