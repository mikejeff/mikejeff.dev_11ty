It feels like I have tried to launch my own personal site no less than 3 dozen times. Each time is a failure for one reason or another. The most common reason is that I can't decide on a reason for the site to exist. Is it a side project to learn a new framework? Is it a side project to share my views on technology, or other subjects? What. Is. It? Depending on the day, I am getting bogged down in either the technology, or the design, or the content, and I end up creating nothing.

I love coding â€” I do it for work, and I do it for fun. It's more interesting to me than most other subjects. I consider my skills in HTML & CSS stronger than skills in other areas, and while I want to become a stronger programmer, I really want to become an expert in UX/UI design and front end development.

This site will be ugly simple and functional because I want to focus on the thing I struggle with the most. Content. I will spend more time writing on this site than I will designing. I will also plan to lean heavily on the principals of progressive enhancement as I learn more about the subject. Basic idea though, is to hit the ground running with a minimum viable product and add features as needed. I can do that. I'll keep a goals page to outline what I want to get out of this project, and keep myself honest and on task.

I hope this helps me improve my writing, because this feels brutal.
